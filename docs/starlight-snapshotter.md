# Starlight Snapshotter Plugin

This is the **step 2** to use Starlight:

Set up the worker to be able to run Starlight. 
This involves 
installing **containerd** and the **Starlight snapshotter plugin**, 
configuring containerd to use the plugin, 
and starting the Starlight snapshotter daemon
(you also need to tell the snapshotter the address of the proxy server).

### Step 1. Install Dependencies
 
The worker machine is supposed to be far away (in latency) to the registry and proxy.
Please install **containerd** and **Starlight snapshotter** on a new machine (or VM), not the same machine that runs the proxy or the registry. 

We use Ubuntu 20.04 as an example. 
The worker machine needs `build-essential` and `containerd`.
```shell
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y && \
sudo apt install -y build-essential containerd
```

Enable `containerd`
```shell
sudo systemctl enable containerd  && \
sudo systemctl start containerd
```

Verify `containerd` is running
```shell
sudo systemctl status containerd
#      Active: active
```

Install Go https://go.dev/doc/install ‚û°Ô∏è
```shell
wget https://go.dev/dl/go1.17.8.linux-amd64.tar.gz && \
sudo rm -rf /usr/local/go && sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.17.8.linux-amd64.tar.gz
```

Add Go to the environment variable (You may want to change `.zshrc` or `.bashrc` file to permanently add this folder to the `PATH` environment variable)
```shell
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
```

Verify Go is available
```shell
go version
# go version go1.17.8 linux/amd64
```

### Step 2. Clone and Build
Clone the Starlight repository
```shell
git clone https://github.com/mc256/starlight.git && \
cd starlight
```

Build the snapshotter plugin and CLI tool
```shell
make build-starlight-grpc build-ctr-starlight
```

### Step 3. Configure Starlight Snapshotter

Install Starlight Snapshotter `systemd` service and CLI tool. 
```shell
sudo make install install-systemd-service
#Please enter Starlight Proxy address (example: proxy.mc256.dev:8090):proxy.mc256.dev:8090
#Enable HTTPS Certificate (requires load balancer like Nginx) (y/N):n
#Created systemd service file (/lib/systemd/system/starlight.service)
#Reloaded systemd daemon
```

Enable Starlight snapshotter service
```shell
sudo systemctl enable starlight   && \
sudo systemctl start starlight
```

Verify Starlight is running
```shell
sudo systemctl status starlight
# it should be "active".
```

### Step 3. Configure `contaienrd`

Add configuration to `/etc/containerd/config.toml`. 
(If you have set other `proxy_plugins`, please manually edit the file)
```shell
cat <<EOT >> /etc/containerd/config.toml
[proxy_plugins]
  [proxy_plugins.starlight]
    type = "snapshot"
    address = "/run/starlight-grpc/starlight-snapshotter.socket"
EOT
```

Restart `containerd` service
```shell
sudo systemctl restart containerd
```

Verify the Starlight snapshotter plugin is functioning
```shell
sudo ctr plugin ls | grep starlight 
# io.containerd.snapshotter.v1    starlight                -              ok
```

üôå That's it. Please proceed to the **Step 3**.
